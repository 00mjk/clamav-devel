.TH "Clam Daemon" "8" "February 12, 2009" "ClamAV @VERSION@" "Clam AntiVirus"
.SH "NAME"
.LP 
clamd \- an anti\-virus daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP 
clamd [options]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
The daemon listens for incoming connections on Unix and/or TCP socket and scans files or directories on demand. It reads the configuration from @CFGDIR@/clamd.conf
.SH "COMMANDS"
.LP 
It's recommended to prefix clamd commands with the letter \fBz\fR (eg. zSCAN) to indicate that the command will be delimited by a NULL character and that clamd should continue reading command data until a newline is read. The null delimiter assures that the complete command and its entire argument will be processed as a single command. Alternatively commands may be prefixed with the letter \fBn\fR (e.g. nSCAN) to use a newline character as the delimiter. Clamd replies will honour the requested terminator in turn.
.LP
Clamd recognizes the following commands:

.TP 
\fBPING\fR
Check the server's state. It should reply with "PONG".
.TP 
\fBVERSION\fR
Print program and database versions.
.TP 
\fBRELOAD\fR
Reload the virus databases.
.TP 
\fBSHUTDOWN\fR
Perform a clean exit.
.TP 
\fBSCAN file/directory\fR
Scan a file or a directory (recursively) with archive support enabled (if not disabled in clamd.conf). A full path is required.
.TP 
\fBCONTSCAN file/directory\fR
Scan file or directory (recursively) with archive support enabled and don't stop the scanning when a virus is found.
.TP 
\fBMULTISCAN file/directory\fR
Scan file in a standard way or scan directory (recursively) using multiple threads (to make the scanning faster on SMP machines).
.TP
\fBINSTREAM\fR
Scan a stream of data. The stream is sent to clamd in chunks, after INSTREAM, on the same socket on which the command was sent.
This avoids the overhead of establishing new TCP connections and problems with NAT. The format of the chunk is: '<lenght><data>' where <length> is the size of the following data in bytes expressed as a 4 byte unsigned integer in network byte order and <data> is the actual chunk. Streaming is terminated by sending a zero-length chunk. Note: do not exceed StreamMaxLength as defined in clamd.conf.
.TP
\fBFILDES\fR
Scan a file descriptor. After issuing a FILDES command a subsequent rfc2292/bsd4.4 style packet is sent to clamd carrying the file descriptor to be scanned inside the ancillary data.
.TP
\fBIDSESSION, END\fR
Start/end a clamd session. Within a session multiple SCAN, INSTREAM, FILDES commands can be sent on the same socket without opening new connections. Replies from clamd will be in the form '<id>:<response>' where <id> is the request number (in ascii, starting from 1) and <response> is the usual clamd reply.
.LP
.TP 
\fBDEPRECATED COMMANDS\fR
.TP
\fBSTREAM\fR
Scan stream \- on this command clamd will return "PORT number" you should connect to and send data to scan. (\fBDEPRECATED\fR, use INSTREAM instead) 
.TP 
\fBSESSION, END\fR
Start/end a clamd session which will allow you to run multiple commands per TCP session. (\fBDEPRECATED\fR, use IDSESSION instead)
.SH "OPTIONS"

Read configuration from FILE.
