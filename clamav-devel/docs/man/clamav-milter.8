.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 

.TP 
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Output the help information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-H, \-\-headers\fR
Include all headers in the content of emails generated by clamav\-milter.
This is useful for systems administrators who may want to look at headers
to check if any of their machines are infected.
.TP 
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Print the version number and exit.
.TP 
\fB\-c FILE, \-\-config\-file=FILE\fR
By default clamav\-milter uses a default configuration file, this option allows you to specify another one.
.TP
\fB\-x n, \-\-debug\fR
Enables debugging.
.TP 
\fB\-x n, \-\-debug\-level=n\fR
Set the debug level to n (where n from [0..9]) if \fBclamav\-milter\fR was
configured with \-\-clamav-debug.
Will be replaced by \-\-debug for compatability with other programs in the
suite.
.TP 
\fB\-b, \-\-bounce\fR
Send a failure message to the sender, and to the postmaster.
[ \fBWarning\fR: most viruses and worms
fake their source address, so this option is not recommended ].
See also \-\-noreject.
.TP
\fB-d, \-\-dont-scan-on-error\fR
If a system error occurs pass messages through unscanned,
usually when a system error occurs the milter raises a temporary failure which
generally causes the message to remain in the queue.
.TP
\fB-f, \-\-force-scan\fR
Always scan, whereever the address came from.
.TP 
\fB-l, \-\-local\fR
Also scan messages sent from LAN.
.TP
\fB-n, \-\-noxheader\fR
Usually clamav\-milter adds a heading to messages that are scanned.
The header is of the form "X-Virus-Scanned: version", this option instructs
clamav\-milter to refrain from adding this heading.
.TP
\fB-N, \-\-noreject\R
When clamav\-milter processes an e-mail which contains a virus it rejects
the e-mail by using the SMTP code 550. This option causes clamav\-milter to
silently discard such messages. It is recommended that systems administrators
use this option when NOT using the \-\-bounce option.
.TP 
\fB-o, \-\-outgoing\fR
Scan outgoing messages from this machine.
.TP
\fB-p, \-\-postmaster=EMAILADDRESS\fR
Sets the e-mail address to send notifications to when the \-\-quiet option
is not given.
.TP
\fB-P, \-\-postmaster-only\fR
When the \-\-bounce option is given, only send a notification to the postmaster,
not the sender.
Setting this flag will include the ID of the message which can ease searching
through system logs if the administrator believes it is a locally sourced
virus.
.TP
\fB-q, \-\-quiet\fR
Don't send any warning messages when a virus or worm or is detected.
This option overrides the \-\-bounce and \-\-postmaster-only options, and is
the way to turn off notification to the postmaster.
.TP
\fB-Q, \-\-quarantine=EMAILADDRESS\fR
If this e-mail address is given, messages containing a virus or worm are
redirected to it.
.TP
\fB-U, \-\-quarantine-dir=DIR\fR
