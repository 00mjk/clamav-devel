clam.exe is an extremely small (544 bytes!) MZ+PE executable that prints
a nice message :-) You can use it to test if your mail scanner using ClamAV
properly scans the attachments.

Due to license issues libclamav does not support RAR 3.0 archives (only 2.0
are supported). Currently only clamscan is able to scan the clam-error.rar
file (clamd only depends on libclamav's decompressors). Please use the --unrar
option and it will automatically switch to the external unrar utility after
libclamav's error.
