Added a command line interface. This allows the client to be used either
in conjunction with download managers which often ask users to specify
a CLI to a AV system to scan files that have been downloaded. It also
allows a full system scan to be done either manually or via the Windows
scheduler, for example
	clamav.exe 192.168.1.1 eicar.com
	clamav.exe 192.168.1.1 c:\

----------------------------
This is a small Windows client for ClamAV that I hope will turn into
something bigger with time.

Since it's so early I'm only releasing the Debug version (you'll need to
install the MFC Debug libary in \windows\system32 if you don't already
have it) and am yet to release the source code.

You will need a clamd server machine where the clamd daemon is listening
on port 3310. When firing up the Windows client you will be asked to
enter in the hostname/IPv4 address of the clamd server. Once you have done
that simply drag 'n' drop files or folders on to the program, they will
then be scanned for viruses.
