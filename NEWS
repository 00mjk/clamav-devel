0.99.3
------

Welcome to ClamAV 0.99.3. In this release, we have included many code
submissions from the ClamAV community:
    - Interfaces to the Prelude SIEM open source package for collecting
      ClamAV virus events.
    - Visual Studio 2015 for building Microsoft Windows binaries.
    - Support libmspack internal code or as a shared object library.
      The internal library is the default and contains additional
      integrity checks.
    - Linking with openssl 1.1.0.
    - Numerous code patches, typos, and compiler warning fixes.

Additionally, we have introduced important changes and new features in
ClamAV 0.99.3, including:
    - Deprecating internal LLVM code support. The configure script has changed
      to search the system for an installed instance of the LLVM development
      libraries, and to otherwise use the bytecode interpreter for ClamAV
      bytecode signatures. To use the LLVM Just-In-Time compiler for
      executing bytecode signatures, please ensure that the LLVM development
      package at version 3.6 or lower is installed. Using the deprecated LLVM
      code is possible with the command: './configure --with-system-llvm=no',
      but it no longer compiles on all platforms.
    - Compute and check PE import table hash (a.k.a. "imphash") signatures.
    - Support file property collection and analysis for MHTML files.
    - Raw scanning of PostScript files.
    - Fix clamsubmit to use the new virus and false positive submission web
      interface.
    - Optionally, flag files with the virus "Heuristic.Limits.Exceeded" when
      size limitations are exceeded.
    - Improve decoders for PDF files.
