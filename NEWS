Scan engine improvements were made. The internal mail scanner now supports
multipart/partial messages, and support for decoding non-standard mail files
was greatly enhanced. clamav-milter by default uses libclamav and scans emails
itself without the use of clamd. libclamav can now extract RFC2397 encoded
data within HTML documents, block zip archives with modified information in
local header, and scan HQX files. PE file structure rebuilding from compressed
executables was improved.


-) libclamav:
    + major improvements in the mail scanning engine:
	o support for multipart/partial messages
	o improved support for non-standard quoted-printable attachments
	o in some situations it will try to guess a correct mode (e.g.
	  a good type for an incorrect content-type, a best guess for an
	  unknown encoding type, etc.)
	o handling of RFC822 comments in the commands (e.g.: Co(foo)ntent-Type:
	  text/plain)
	o better recovery if memory softlimit is hit
	o new test code that decodes emails without parsing them first (must
	  be enabled manually before compilation)

    + support for extracting RFC2397 encoded data within HTML documents
    + blocking of zip archives with modified information in local header
    + improved PE structure rebuilding from compressed executables
    + improved support for zip archives
    + support for Mac's HQX file format
    + stability and (minor) security fixes
    + a lot of minor improvements, including support for new platforms

-) clamd:
    + new directive ExitOnOOM (stop the deamon when libclamav reports an out of
      memory condition)
    + new directives StreamMinPort and StreamMaxPort (port range specification
      for a stream mode)
    + support for passing of file descriptors

-) clamdscan:
    + added support for --move and --remove

-) clamav-milter:
    + by default uses libclamav to scan e-mails
    + new option --external (enables the use of clamd)
    + various optimisations

-) freshclam:
    + the DNS mode is now enabled by default (no need for DNSDatabaseInfo in
      freshclam.conf)
    + --no-dns uses a If-Modified-Since method instead of a range GET
    + added support for AllowSupplementaryGroups

-) sigtool:
    + new options --vba and --vba-hex (extract VBA/Word6 macros and optionally
      display the corresponding hex values; Word6 binary code will be
      disassembled)
