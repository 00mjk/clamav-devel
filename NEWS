0.99.3
------

Welcome to ClamAV 0.99.3. In this release, we have included many code
submissions from the ClamAV community:
    - Interfaces to Prelude open source SIEM.
    - Visual Studio 2015 for building Microsoft Windows binaries.
    - Support libmspack code internally or as a shared object library.
    - Linking with openssl 1.1.0.
    - Numerous code patches, typos, and compiler warnings.

Additionally, we have introduced important changes and new features in
ClamAV 0.99.3, including:
    - Deprecating internal LLVM code support. The configure script has changed
      to search the system for an installed instance of the LLVM development
      libraries, and to otherwise use the bytecode interpreter for ClamAV
      bytecode signatures. Using the deprecated internal LLVM code is possible
      with the command: './configure --with-system-llvm=no'
    - Compute and check PE import table hash (a.k.a. "imphash") signatures.
    - Support file property collection and analysis for MHTML files.
    - Raw scanning of PostScript files.
    - Fix clamsubmit to use the new virus and false positive submission web
      interface.
    - Optionally, flag files with the virus "Heuristic.Limits.Exceeded" when
      size limitations are exceeded.
    - Improve decoders for PDF files.
