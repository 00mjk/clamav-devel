This version fixes vulnerabilities in handling of UPX and FSG compressed
executables. Support for PE files, Zip and Cabinet archives has been improved
and other small bugfixes have been made. The new option "--on-outdated-execute"
allows freshclam to run a command when system reports a new engine version.
