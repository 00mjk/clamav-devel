    - unpacker for NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) self-extracting
      archives
    - unpacker for ASPack 2.12
    - new implementation of the Aho-Corasick pattern matcher providing
      better detection for wildcard enabled signatures
    - support for nibble matching and floating offsets
    - improved handling of .mdb files (fixes long startup times)
    - extraction of PE files embedded into other executables
    - better handling of PE & UPX
    - removed dependency on libcurl (improves stability)
    - IPv6 support in clamav-milter
    - many other improvements and bugfixes
