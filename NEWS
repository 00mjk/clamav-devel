0.94.1rc1
---------

ClamAV 0.94.1rc1 fixes some issues that were found in previous releases and
includes one new feature, "Malware Statistics Gathering." This is an optional
feature that allows ClamAV users optionally to submit statistics to us about
what they detect in the field. We will then use these data to determine what
types of malware are the most detected in the field and in what geographic
area they are. It will also allow us to publish summary data on www.clamav.net
where our users will be able to monitor the latest threats. You can help us
by enabling SubmitDetectionStats in freshclam.conf.
