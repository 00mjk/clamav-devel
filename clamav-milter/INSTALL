BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

A makefile was supplied with this which should have built the program. If it
fails please let us know, and here are some hints for building on different
platforms.

Tested OK on Linux/x86 with gcc3.2.
	cc -O3 -pedantic -Wuninitialized -Wall -pipe -mcpu=pentium -march=pentium -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -funroll-loops clamav-milter.c -pthread -lmilter ../libclamav/.libs/libclamav.a ../clamd/cfgfile.o ../clamd/others.o

Compiles OK on Linux/x86 with tcc 0.9.16, but fails to link errors with 'atexit'
	tcc -g -b -lmilter -lpthread clamav-milter.c...

Fails to compile on Linux/x86 with icc6.0 (complains about stdio.h...)
	icc -O3 -tpp7 -xiMKW -ipo -parallel -i_dynamic -w2 clamav-milter.c...
Fails to build on Linux/x86 with icc7.1 with -ipo (fails on libclamav.a - keeps saying run ranlib). Otherwise it builds and runs OK.
	icc -O2 -tpp7 -xiMKW -parallel -i_dynamic -w2 -march=pentium4 -mcpu=pentium4 clamav-milter.c...

Tested with Electric Fence 2.2.2

Compiles OK on Linux/ppc (YDL2.3) with gcc2.95.4. Needs -lsmutil to link.
	cc -O3 -pedantic -Wuninitialized -Wall -pipe -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -funroll-loop -pthread -lmilter ../libclamav/.libs/libclamav.a ../clamd/cfgfile.o ../clamd/others.o -lsmutil
I haven't tested it further on this platform yet.
YDL3.0 should compile out of the box

Sendmail on MacOS/X (10.1) is provided without a development package so this
can't be run "out of the box"

Solaris 8 doesn't have milter support so clamav-milter won't work unless you
rebuild sendmail from source.
Solaris 9 has milter support in the supplied sendmail, but doesn't include
libmilter so you can't develop milter applications on it. Go to sendmail.org,
download the lastest sendmail, cd to libmilter and "make install" there.
Needs -lresolv

FreeBSD4.7 use /usr/local/bin/gcc30. GCC3.0 is an optional extra on
FreeBSD. It comes with getopt.h which is handy. To link you need
-lgnugetopt
	gcc30 -O3 -DCONFDIR=\"/usr/local/etc\" -I. -I.. -I../clamd -I../libclamav -pedantic -Wuninitialized -Wall -pipe -mcpu=pentium -march=pentium -fomit-frame-pointer -ffast-math -finline-functions -funroll-loops clamav-milter.c -pthread -lmilter ../libclamav/.libs/libclamav.a ../clamd/cfgfile.o ../clamd/others.o -lgnugetopt

FreeBSD4.8: should compile out of the box
OpenBSD3.3: the supplied sendmail does not come with Milter support. You
will need to rebuild sendmail from source

INSTALLATION

Install into /usr/local/sbin/clamav-milter, mode 744

See http://www.nmt.edu/~wcolburn/sendmail-8.12.5/libmilter/docs/sample.html

Installations for RedHat Linux and it's derivatives such as YellowDog:
	Ensure that you have the sendmail-devel RPM installed
	Add to /etc/mail/sendmail.mc:
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`clamav', `S=local:/var/run/clamav.sock, F=, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
	define(`confINPUT_MAIL_FILTERS', `clamav')

	Check entry in /usr/local/etc/clamav.conf of the form:
	LocalSocket /var/run/clamd.sock
	StreamSaveToDisk

	If you already have a filter (such as spamassassin-milter from
	http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/spamass-milt) add it thus:
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`clamav', `S=local:/var/run/clamav.sock, F=, T=S:4m;R:4m')dnl
	INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`spamassassin', `S=local:/var/run/spamass.sock, F=, T=C:15m;S:4m;R:4m;E:10m')
	define(`confINPUT_MAIL_FILTERS', `spamassassin,clamav')dnl

You may find INPUT_MAIL_FILTERS is not needed on your machine, however it
is recommended by the Sendmail documentation and I recommend going along
with that.

I suggest putting SpamAssassin first since you're more likely to get spam
than a virus/worm sent to you.

Add to /etc/sysconfig/clamav-milter
	CLAMAV_FLAGS="--max-children=2 local:/var/run/clamav.sock"
or if clamd is on a different machine
	CLAMAV_FLAGS="--max-children=2 --server=192.168.1.9 local:/var/run/clamav.sock"

You should have received a script to put into /etc/init.d with this software.

run 'chown clamav /usr/local/sbin/clamav-milter; chmod 4700 /usr/local/sbin/clamav-milter
