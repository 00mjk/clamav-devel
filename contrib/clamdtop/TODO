select one clamd when monitoring more, and show details for that only
parse pool states, and show those that are != VALID
highlight problems in version/dbversion/dbtime (old db version, old dbtime,
different db versions).
write a manpage
check that it works for clamd w/o STATS support (version should still work).
consider writing a GUI using Tk 8.5 (version 8.5 has much nicer widgets than 8.4)
integrate into toplevel clamav, and build if ncurses is available (optional)
figure out minimum version of ncurses required, I used 5.5 during development.
describe what the various fields mean, like what live/idle threads mean and why
describe why the multiscan view is split
explain what queue means, and why it is high with multiscan
