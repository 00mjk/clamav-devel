monitor more than one remote clamd
write a manpage
consider writing a GUI using Tk 8.5 (version 8.5 has much nicer widgets than 8.4)
integrate into toplevel clamav, and build if ncurses is available (optional)
figure out minimum version of ncurses required, I used 5.5 during development.
show mempool statistics too.
reconnect after a DB reload (we get a broken pipe)
describe what the various fields mean, like what live/idle threads mean and why
describe why the multiscan view is split
explain what queue means, and why it is high with multiscan
figure a solution to represent multiple multiscan commands (though why would
somebody run 2 in parallel?)
