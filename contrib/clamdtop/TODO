monitor more than one remote clamd
write a manpage
consider writing a GUI using Tk 8.5 (version 8.5 has much nicer widgets than 8.4)
integrate into toplevel clamav, and build if ncurses is available (optional)
figure out minimum version of ncurses required, I used 5.5 during development.
show mempool statistics too.
reconnect after a DB reload (we get a broken pipe)
